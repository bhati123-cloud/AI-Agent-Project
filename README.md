# AI Agent Project

## 🔍 Objective
This project demonstrates an autonomous AI Agent that automates the end-to-end process of data analysis on a public dataset. It covers dataset discovery, ingestion, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), insight generation, and reporting — all with minimal human intervention.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
The AI Agent is designed to:
1. Identify and select a relevant public dataset (e.g., E-Commerce Sales, Customer Behavior).
2. Automatically download and preprocess the dataset.
3. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), including:
   - Basic statistics
   - Missing value treatment
   - Outlier detection
4. Detect 3–5 meaningful insights such as trends, anomalies, or correlations.
5. Generate a structured report (Markdown or HTML).
6. Export the final insight report to a local file.

## 📊 Example Dataset
This agent works with a real-world dataset related to **E-Commerce Sales**, which includes files like:
- `Amazon Sale Report.csv`
- `International Sale Report.csv`
- `Expense IIGF.csv`
- etc.
